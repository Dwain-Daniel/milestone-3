<h1>Milestone Project</h1>

<img src="static/images/techsini.PNG">
My site can be viewed at https://dwain-daniel.github.io/Milestone-1/ 


This project will be used to display all that I have learned so far. I will be using this project to build a website for food lovers to come and save their recipes. Other users
will be able to view these as well as add, edit and delete their own recipes, should they choose to sign up. I want the website to be easily accessible, simple to navigate and user freindly. 
It must also be displayed for various devices (desktop ,Tablet, Mobile Phone) whilst maintaining a great user experience . Links within the website directing me to other pages either within this website
or to other social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).

<h3> Design </h3>

<h4>Colour Scheme</h4>

I have used an amber and white theme. I have used this as it is bright and attractive. The theme is consistent throughout the site which is good for the UI/UX. The header and footers 
are both amber with white text and icons.The background is white, with black text.  
fit the colour theme.

<h4>Icons </h4>

I have incorporated icons from Font Awesome, thes have a functional purpose of highlighting certain input fields for the user.

<h4>Defensive Design</h4>
<li>To submit and edit recipe form, the category has to be chosen</li>
<li>The servings, preparation time, cook time and total time has to be numbered.</li>
<li>A recipe or category can't be deleted by just one click.</li>
<li>If someone clicks on the delete button, there wil be a modal with a confirmation if someone is sure to delete the recipe or category.</li>

<h4>Wireframe</h4>

Below are the original wireframe designs I created in my designs. The final version whilst similar doesnt match exactly.
My wireframes can be found in my wireframes folder.

<h4>Features</h4>

<li>The links in the footer, contact and resume pages all take you to the pages described, in new tabs.</li>
<li>Site is responsive to different device sizes.</li>
<li>Flavours logo is found in the top left of all pages, this will take the user to the home page.</li>
<li>The links are located to the right of the page, these will colapse into a navigation tab one smaller devices.</li>
<li>The navigation links and buttons show a slight shadowing to let the user know that they are above a clickable button.</li>
<li>Flash messages appear to let the user know what they have done for example a successful recipe submission.</li>
<li>The footer is designed to remain at the bottom of the page no matter how much information is on the page.</li>
<li>Once the user is signed in they have full functionality of the site. Non registered users can only see the Log In, Home and Register tabs.</li>

<li>I placed my site throught a CSS Validator which returned no errors</li>

<h3>Test User Stories</h3>

<h4>New Users</h4>

I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn a variety of meal recipes.
Upon entering the site, users will see the website name in the top left corner, Flavours!, followed by a variety of links in the top right.
Below that there is a text section detailing what the site is about and its aims. This should have enough information to get me to register an account.
I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
The header will contain links to the other pages, this will be a responsive menu that will collapse on a mobile device. 
The footer will contain copyright logo and the website name again.
I can use the Contact page to find out how to find out further social media links.


<h4>Returning Users</h4>
 
I can find the log in section quite easily both with the log in button in the nav bar but also the link on the register page.
Submitting a recipe is very easy with all text fields clearly labelled and formatted to only allow the relevant text.
The search function works very well, if I want a recipe containing chicken for example all chicken recipes will appear 
All other recipes will be listed on the home page.
 

<h3>Deployment</h3>
The project was deployed on GitHub Pages. I used Gitpod as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system.
I used push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub.

I have used GitHub Pages to deploy the page using the following steps:

<li>I logged in to GitHub and located the GitHub Repository Milestone Project 1</li>
<li>I then clicked the Settings button on the menu.</li>
<li>I scrolled down the Settings page to the "GitHub Pages" Section.</li>
<li>Under "Source" I selected "Master Branch".</li>
<li>The link was then published in the "GitHub Pages" section.</li>
